        This policy validates which sysctls can get set in pods by specifying lists
        of sysctls or sysctl patterns to be allowed or forbidden. You can then
        modify the securityContext of Pods to make use of the Sysctls as permitted
        by this policy.

        list. To forbid setting any sysctls, use * on its own.
